<h1>IB (International Baccalaureate)</h1>
<p> In my school, there are several programs for different students:
<ul>
<li>Business Management and IT </li>
<li>Design, education, and hospitality.</li>
<li>Health, publlic service and law</li>
<li>Visual and Performing Arts</li>
<li>Communication, Arts, Film, and Digital Media</li>
<li>International Baccalarueate</li>
<li>Academy of Finance</li>
<li>Cavalier teaching academy</li>
</ul>
I happen to be in the IB or otherwise known as the International baccalaureate academy.
My academy is a very academically based academy, at the moment, i won't actually be 
considered an IB student until I'm a junior. This is because that is when IB actually starts. 
On their website is says that any student aged 16 to 19 is eligible for an IB diploma, so right now,
i am being prepared for the program with specific classes that are more adavanced than those of other
students. The international baccalaureate (organization) Describes it as "The International BaccalaureateÂ® (IB) offers a continuum of international education. 
The programmes encourage both personal and academic achievement, 
challenging students to excel in their studies and in their personal development.
... Every school authorized to offer IB programmes is known as an IB World School." (source: <a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/"> https://www.ibo.org/programmes/)</a>
